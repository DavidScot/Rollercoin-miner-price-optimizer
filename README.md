# Vanilla JavaScript browser console application for Rollercoin

## A JavaScript project of decision support for buying rollercoin miners

This project is intended to help rollercoin players decide which miner to buy 
according to the best **Power/Cost ratio**. 
Each miner has several characteristics:  

* Name
* Power
* Cost
* Bonus Power
* etc.

When inside the marketplace, some characteristics about the miners (name, price, available amount, etc.) are displayed.  
However, it is not possible to see the **Power** provided by the miner when on this page.  
This is not very practical and players are forced to click on a miner to see the power it provides.  
This project helps to select the miner that has the best **Power/Cost ratio**  
without clicking on each miner displayed on the page to compare their characteristics.

### Results

![image info](./edited_2.png)

The list of miners available in the game is not comprehensive yet.
By consequence, data about some miners are not available and thus can not be processed.  

For that reason, there is a message at the end of the execution detailing the miners that has not been processed.
